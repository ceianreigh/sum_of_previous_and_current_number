# Write a program to iterate the first 10 numbers, and in each iteration, print the sum of the current and previous number.

# pseudocode

# create a variable called previous_number and set it to 0

# create a for loop that iterates 10 times

# create a variable called current_number and set it to i

# create a variable called sum_of_previous_and_current_number and set it to previous_number + current_number

# print sum_of_previous_and_current_number

# update previous_number to current_number
